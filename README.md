# Supervised-learning
This file includes application of algorithms like logistic regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes and KNN and comparing their classification performances on their test dataset. 
The project and dataset description is included in the file titled 'Supervised Learning Problem Statement.pdf'
The dataset is named 'Bank_Personal_Loan_Modelling.csv'
